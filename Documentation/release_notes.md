	* Removed some of the loose extensions
* You can also set the timing priority on ``triggerAtTimeProgress()`` or ``triggerAtValueProgress()``. 


####Version 0.5.0

* Updated the naming convention of the easing curves by removing the 'Ease' prefix on the enumerator to make swift-like syntax, now you can easily access animations without being presented too many types.
